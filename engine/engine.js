/* engine.js: one learner's frames in, the tutor's effects out -- with no DOM.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Version 1 kept the per-frame pipeline in the browser
 * glue (experiments/asl-tutor.js): push the frame at the committer, grade a
 * commit, apply what the flow said. The flow's RULES were tested under Node
 * and the committer's STILLNESS was tested under Node, but the dozen lines that
 * joined them ran only in a browser, and that is exactly where the first
 * camera session broke (2026-09-20): every trial boundary re-armed the
 * committer under a hand that had not moved, so one held pose was graded
 * against letter after letter, and a finished trial was replaced by the next
 * letter before its feedback could be read. Nothing under `node --test` could
 * have seen either, because nothing under `node --test` ran a second trial.
 *
 * So the join lives here now: the committer, the flow, the hold-offs and the
 * end-of-trial dwell, driven by (tMs, landmarks) and nothing else. The glue
 * keeps what genuinely needs a browser -- the DOM, the model fetch, the
 * runner's addEvent/endTrial -- and tools/make-tutor-replay.mjs runs THIS
 * file to lay down its recording, so the smoke scenario is checked against
 * the same pipeline the page runs rather than against a description of it.
 *
 * TIME COMES IN, IT IS NEVER READ: tMs is the runner's per-trial clock, which
 * restarts near zero at every trial. */

 *
 *   holdMs 900, settleMs 300   600 ms was too quick to feel like a decision --
 *       a hand pausing on its way somewhere was graded. The ring appears once
 *       the learner has actually stopped, and they then have a visible 0.6 s
 *       to change their mind.
 *   stillPerFinger, stillTol 0.10 (and, until 2026-09-21, placeTol 0.3)   on real tracked video the
 *       plain maximum at 0.06 broke 12% of the frames inside a genuinely held
 *       letter and let 11 of 60 holds close a 600 ms ring. What moved was the
 *       hand as a whole, plus single hopping landmarks -- not the fingers. So
 *       SHAPE (palm centre removed; per finger, its second largest landmark)
 *       is judged tightly and PLACE loosely. In the comparison script, at the
 *       same 600 ms hold, that closed 42 of 60; through THIS committer with
 *       THESE options, on a real clip at half speed (learner-like holds), it
 *       closes 20 of 22 against 6 for the plain rule, and the grader accepts
 *       what they commit (tutor/commit.js DEFAULTS;
 *       research/live/eval-still-policies.mjs; tests/real-holds.test.js). A
 *       finger still curling cannot commit (guaranteed once its tip travels
 *       about 0.26 palm widths a second at 30 fps, 0.35 at 12 fps -- slower
 *       than that and the 230 ms the grader reads is not blurred by it
 *       anyway); a hand merely gliding sideways
 *       can, and is graded exactly as if it were still, because the features
 *       do not know where the hand is (tests/tutor-engine.test.js has both).
 *   stillAlign, placeTol 1.0   the owner, after the first recorded session:
 *       "if I move my hand, don't hold it still, it doesn't detect the letter".
 *       It did not: with their own recording swayed half a palm side to side
 *       the ring closed on 5 of 57 letters, rocked 12 degrees at the wrist on
 *       10, both on none -- three degrees of rock moves a fingertip the whole
 *       shape tolerance, and place was held to 0.3 palm widths (2-3 cm). The
 *       ANSWER is a shape kept for a second, not a hand kept in one spot, so
 *       shape is now compared with the turn taken out as well as without
 *       (tutor/commit.js stillAlign) and the hand may wander a palm width
 *       from where the hold began. Same recording, same motions: 57 of 57,
 *       with the verdicts it got held still; as recorded, no letter is graded
 *       earlier and wrong, and several close 0.5-1 s sooner
 *       (research/recordings-2026-09-21/). What still cannot commit: a finger
 *       moving (unchanged), and a hand going somewhere -- more than a palm
 *       width in the 1.2 s, which is an arm being raised, not an answer.
 *   heldOverPlace Infinity   the price of the line above. A pose carried over
 *       a trial boundary used to re-arm by SHAPE or by PLACE (0.6 palm widths):
 *       harmless while a hand that was moving could not commit anyway. Now it
 *       can, so a learner still holding up the last letter and swaying would
 *       re-arm by place and have the old letter graded against the new one --
 *       the burst of the first camera session, back for anyone who does not
 *       keep still. Across a boundary only a change of SHAPE (or the hand
 *       going away) re-arms. The status line already asks for exactly that
 *       ("Relax your hand, then make this letter").
 *   rearmAfterMs 3500   a correction too small to register as movement is
 *       still graded if it is held for 3.5 s after the verdict. Safe only
 *       because of SAME_POSE_TOL below: a hand that has NOT changed is never
 *       charged a second attempt, however the ring came to close on it again.
 *
 * WHAT THE REAL-VIDEO NUMBERS ARE AND ARE NOT. They come from a comparison
 * script at a 600 ms hold on fluent signers who hold a letter 0.7-1.7 s; at
 * this tutor's 900 ms almost none of those holds is long enough to close
 * under ANY rule (9 of 60; the plain rule 0). The tolerance was not read off
 * a knee in that data -- there is none, and no negative examples to make one.
 * It was set from the other side: what motion must still break a hold.
