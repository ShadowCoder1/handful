/* flow.js: one trial of the tutor, as a pure state machine.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Everything the tutor DECIDES lives here: which attempt is
 * consumed, what the learner is told, when the trial ends, what goes in the
 * log and what the schedule is told afterwards. Nothing here touches the DOM,
 * a clock, the network or Math.random -- it takes events in and returns a list
 * of EFFECTS, and experiments/asl-tutor.js is the only file that turns those
 * into pixels, log entries and endTrial() calls.
 *
 * WHY THE SPLIT. A tutor's rules are the part that is easy to get subtly wrong
 * and impossible to check by eye: "does an abstain consume an attempt", "is
 * this trial a first-time success", "which of two blamed blocks does the
 * learner hear about, and when". Fused into a browser file, those can only be
 * checked by a person with a webcam. Here they run under `node --test`
 * (tests/tutor-flow.test.js) with a stub verifier, and every rule below has a
 * test that fails if it changes.
 *
 * TIME COMES IN, IT IS NEVER READ. Retrieval latency and the status
 * rate-limiter both need a clock, and both take it from the event -- the
 * runner's per-trial tMs, which restarts near 0 every trial. A pure reducer
 * that reads Date.now() is not a pure reducer.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: the ring (tutor/commit.js decides when an
 * attempt exists), the model (tutor/verifier.js grades it), the blame
 * (tutor/blame.js), the words (tutor/letters.js) and which letter comes next
 * (tutor/schedule-dropout.js). Those are injected as `deps` so the tests can
 * stub the two that need a 600 KB model file, and so this file cannot quietly
 * grow a second opinion about any of them. */
