/* verifier.js: grades one hand against a KNOWN target letter, in the
 * browser, every frame.
 *
 * The target is known on every trial, so this is VERIFICATION, not
 * recognition: "is this an acceptable R?", answered with accept, reject, or
 * abstain. Abstain is a first-class answer, not a failure -- a tutor that
 * must produce a verdict will produce a wrong one, and a wrong verdict on a
 * hand the camera barely saw is worse for a learner than silence.
 *
 * TWO NUMBERS, DOING DIFFERENT JOBS (training/gaussian_model.py has the long
 * version). `score` is RELATIVE: the target's log-likelihood minus the best
 * of every other class, the 23 other letters and the "_background" class
 * alike. It answers "more like the target than like anything else I know?"
 * and it cannot reject a hand that is unlike every letter, because such a
 * hand is still relatively most like one of them -- the spike measured an
 * ungated score accepting 100% of non-letter hands as some letter. `d2` is
 * ABSOLUTE: squared Mahalanobis distance from the target's own Gaussian,
 * i.e. "a typical instance of this letter at all?". That is what rejects
 * garbage, and every accept is gated on it.
 *
 * THE ORDER OF THE CHECKS IN `verify`, AND WHY EACH IS WHERE IT IS:
 *
 *   1. a non-finite feature -> abstain "not-gradable". features.js reports
 *      NaN when the hand was degenerate (tracking dropped out), so the hand
 *      was never measured and every number below would be built on nothing.
 *      It is first because it is the only failure that makes the others
 *      meaningless -- including the tier, which would otherwise log a score
 *      for a hand nobody saw.
 *   2. standardize -- the Gaussians live in a fixed mean/sd space, so a raw
 *      angle in degrees and a palm-width-normalized distance are comparable.
 *   3. tier 2 -> abstain "tier2", score and distance still computed and
 *      returned for logging. A tier-2 letter did not clear even the lenient
 *      development bar (training/MODEL_REPORT.md), so it is taught and shown
 *      but never given a verdict. It comes BEFORE the tracking check because
 *      "fix your camera" would be a lie about a letter that gets no verdict
 *      however well it was tracked.
 *   4. tracking quality -> abstain "tracking". The hand may be perfect; we
 *      could not see it well enough to say so.
 *   5. decide -- the gate, then the two thresholds, then the band between
 *      them where the evidence supports nothing.
 *
 * `decide` is exported separately and does step 5 (plus 1 and 3) on an
 * ALREADY-STANDARDIZED vector, with no quality checks at all: the block
 * blame that comes next re-decides on modified standardized vectors and
 * must reach exactly the same verdict machinery, not a second copy of it.
 * Both it and `verify` take an options object whose one option,
 * `ignoreTier` (strictly `true`, nothing truthy), skips step 3 for callers
 * that need the verdict the tier hides -- never for anything a learner
 * sees. Any result it changed is marked `tierIgnored: true`, and every
 * other result carries `tierIgnored: false`, so a consumer or a log can
 * always tell a tier-blind decision from a real one without knowing how it
 * was called. See `decide` below.
 *
 * PINNED TO PYTHON. training/decide.py carries the same rules, branch for
 * branch, and tests/fixtures/verifier-parity.json holds real hands scored by
 * it; tests/verifier.test.js demands agreement to 1e-6 and refuses to run at
 * all if the fixture was generated from a different tutor/model.json.
 *
 * HOW CLOSE "AGREE" IS. Both sides read the same written JSON numbers (8
 * significant digits) and `standardize` is the same two IEEE operations in
 * the same order on both, so the standardized vector is identical bit for
 * bit. The SCORE is not: numpy accumulates its sums in a different order
 * from the fused row loop here, and measured over the fixture and a sweep of
 * model variants the two differ by up to about 1e-10 in score and distance.
 * That is seven orders of magnitude inside the 1e-6 the parity test demands,
 * and it means exactly one thing for behavior: a hand whose score sits
 * within ~1e-10 of a threshold can fall on different sides of it in the two
 * implementations. Nothing rides on such a hand -- the thresholds are
 * bootstrap numbers with three significant digits of meaning, and a score
 * that close to a threshold is a coin toss about a borderline hand either
 * way -- but "bit for bit" would be a false claim and this is the true one.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS CALIBRATED. Every threshold is read from the model file,
 * never written down here, and those thresholds are BOOTSTRAP: fitted on
 * public datasets of posed hands, cross-source rather than cross-signer,
 * with no learner of this tutor contributing a single hand.
