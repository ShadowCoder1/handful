/* blame.js: when a hand is rejected, WHICH articulator should the learner
 * move -- and would moving it actually have been enough?
 *
 * A rejection is not feedback. "That is not an R" leaves a learner with 46
 * numbers' worth of ways to be wrong and no idea which one they are. The
 * tutor has to name one thing to fix, and the unit it names is a BLOCK: the
 * group of features one articulator controls (features.js), because a block
 * is the smallest group of numbers that maps back to something a hand can
 * actually do.
 *
 * THE COUNTERFACTUAL. The grader is one full-covariance Gaussian per letter,
 * so "what if this block were right?" has a closed form. For block index set
 * b, the rest of the hand r, and the target letter's mean mu and precision P:
 *
 *     mu_{b|r} = mu_b - P_bb^-1 P_br (z_r - mu_r)
 *
 * -- the mean of that block under the target letter GIVEN the rest of the
 * hand as it actually was. Not the marginal mean mu_b: the features are
 * correlated, and a thumb that is right for this particular index finger is
 * not the same as a thumb that is right on average. Put that block's
 * conditional mean into a copy of z, re-score, and the change in score is
 * what fixing the block would buy. The block that buys the most is blamed.
 *
 * P_bb^-1 is never formed. `solve(P_bb, P_br (z_r - mu_r))` gets the same
 * vector without inverting a 19x19 matrix. In exact arithmetic that solve
 * cannot fail -- a principal submatrix of a positive-definite matrix is
 * positive-definite, and loadModel has already factored the whole thing --
 * but the arithmetic is not exact: `solve` refuses a pivot that is small
 * RELATIVE to the largest entry in the block, and a precision matrix scaled
 * badly enough can pass loadModel's Cholesky and still be too ill-conditioned
 * here. That is a broken model, not a bad hand, so it throws -- naming the
 * block and the letter, because a bare linear-algebra complaint from inside a
 * hint is a stack nobody can place.
 *
 * THE MOVE GOES TO THE CONDITIONAL MEAN, not to the acceptance boundary. The
 * design (A5.3) asks for the smallest move that would be accepted, which is a
 * better description of what a learner has to do -- but "how far is far
 * enough" is a question about real hands, and there are none yet: the model
 * in this slice is bootstrap, fitted on public datasets of posed hands, with
 * no learner of this tutor in it. Moving to the mean is the version whose
 * arithmetic means something without captured data; the boundary refinement
 * waits for it.
 *
 * THE SELF-CONSISTENCY CHECK, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. Before a hint is shown,
 * `chooseCorrection` re-decides the corrected vector and only offers the hint
 * if the model would then accept it. That is the model checking its OWN
 * ARITHMETIC -- nothing more. A learner cannot move their thumb without
 * moving their index finger, their palm and the camera's view of all three,
 * so a hint that passes this check is not thereby shown to be physically
 * actionable, and this module makes no such claim. Whether hints work is an
 * empirical question, answered later by P(accept on the next attempt | hint
 * shown) on captured data (A1.4). What the check does buy is the opposite
 * guarantee, which is worth having: the tutor never says "fix your thumb"
 * about a hand that would still be rejected with a perfect thumb. When no
 * one- or two-block correction gets there, the honest answer is to show the
 * whole sign, and that is what `fallback` says.
 *
 * BLOCKS ARE RANKED PER UNIT OF WIDTH, NOT BY RAW GAIN. The blocks are very
 * different sizes -- 19 features in the thumb, 5 in the spread, 6 in
 * orientation, 4 in each finger -- and a wide block earns score just by being
 * wide: moving 19 features to their conditional mean soaks up whatever
 * ordinary atypicality those 19 happened to carry, whether or not the thumb
 * is what is wrong. Measured on U hands graded as R, the thumb's fix RAISED
 * the rival U's log-likelihood by 2.29 while the spread's LOWERED it by 1.34,
 * and the thumb still won on raw gain. That is the old "19 redundant thumb
 * features outvote 6 orientation features" objection (docs/specs/
 * review-dispositions.md B3) arriving by a different road.
 *
 * So blocks are ordered by `rank` = gain / sqrt(block size), and both numbers
 * are reported: `gain` is what the correction is worth in score, `rank` is
 * what decided the blame. The divisor was not picked by taste -- it was
 * chosen by a pre-declared evaluation over 11 minimal pairs and 330 real
 * hands, against raw gain and against a chi-square-style standardization,
 * choosing on one half of the rows and reporting on the other.
 * docs/BLAME_EVALUATION.md has the table, the protocol and the limits.
 *
 * ORIENTATION FIRST (A5.2). A hand held the wrong way and a hand with the
 * wrong finger flexion are not equally urgent: orientation is what the
 * receiver sees first, and several pairs (G/Q, K/P, U/H) differ in nothing
 * else. So a positive orientation RANK within 80% of the best block's takes
 * the correction even when a finger block ranks a little higher. The rule
 * compares the same number the blame was decided on; comparing gains while
 * ranking by rank would let a block jump a queue it was never near.
 *
 * TIER-BLIND ON PURPOSE. Every score here comes from `decide(..., {
 * ignoreTier: true })`. A tier-2 letter gets no verdict shown to a learner,
 * but a tier-aware `decide` answers "abstain, tier2" for every block and
 * every counterfactual alike, which is no answer at all -- and most letters
 * are tier 2 in the current bootstrap model, so blame would be blind exactly
 * where it is most needed. Nothing here is user-facing on its own: it
 * produces the block names a caller may choose to phrase a hint from, and
 * whether a tier-2 letter gets a hint at all is that caller's decision.
 *
 * This runs once per rejected attempt -- not per frame -- so it is written
 * for clarity rather than for speed: seven blocks, seven small solves and
 * eight re-scores, well under a millisecond on the real model.
