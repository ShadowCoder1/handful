/* pick-hand.js: when both hands are in the picture, which one is the learner's.
 *
 * The study asks for ONE hand (experiments/asl-study.js studyHand). With the
 * tracker told to find a single hand, MediaPipe returned whichever it was
 * surest of, and the dots jumped to the other hand whenever it came into view
 * (JT, 2026-09-23). So the tracker now looks for two, and this picks the one
 * asked for; the other is never graded, drawn or saved.
 *
 * In order:
 *   1. MediaPipe's label. With two hands in view it rarely labels both the
 *      same; on this platform's UNMIRRORED frames a physical right hand reads
 *      "Right" (research/live/REPORT.md section 1).
 *   2. If the labels do not settle it, the hand's own geometry (tutor/hand-frame.js
 *      chirality), when it is clear: +1 is a right hand.
 *   3. Otherwise, the hand nearer to where the chosen hand was last frame, so
 *      the dots do not flicker between two hands on an ambiguous frame.
 *
 * ONE hand in view is passed through whichever it is: a learner using the
 * wrong hand is told so by the tutor ("Use your right hand."), which needs to
 * see it. */
