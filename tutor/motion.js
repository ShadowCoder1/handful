/* motion.js: J and Z, the two letters that are MOVEMENTS.
 *
 * Every other letter is a handshape held still, graded by the model. J is an
 * I (pinky out) that draws a J in the air; Z is an index finger that draws a
 * Z. There is no public data of either as landmark sequences, so this is a
 * RULE, stated in numbers, not a trained model:
 *
 *   shape  a finger is "out" when its tip is at least EXT times as far from
 *          the wrist as its knuckle, "curled" when at most CURL times. On the
 *          owner's recorded holds straight fingers read 1.49-2.05 and curled
 *          ones 0.38-1.13 (research/allletters-2026-09-22/).
 *            J: pinky out; index, middle, ring curled.
 *            Z: index out; middle, ring, pinky curled.
 *   motion over the frames in that shape during the few seconds before the
 *          hand came to rest, the moving fingertip (smoothed) must have:
 *            J: travelled at least J_DROP palm-lengths down and J_HOOK across.
 *            Z: spanned Z_WIDTH across and Z_DROP down, and reversed its
 *               sideways direction at least twice (right, back, right).
 *
 * Palm-length = wrist to middle knuckle, so the rule does not care how far
 * the hand is from the camera. The learner draws the letter, then holds the
 * end pose still like any other letter; the hold is what triggers grading. */
