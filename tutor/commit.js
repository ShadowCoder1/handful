/* commit.js: turns a stream of tracked-hand frames into discrete ATTEMPTS.
 *
 * FRAMES ARE NOT ANSWERS. While a learner is still forming a handshape, every
 * intermediate frame is a real hand caught mid-motion; grading it would
 * punish the formation phase, not the shape. So this module waits for the
 * hand to go STILL -- a hold-still ring fills while landmark displacement
 * stays under tolerance -- and only the moment that hold completes is an
 * attempt.
 *
 * WHY THE LEARNER DECLARES THE ATTEMPT, rather than the tutor deciding for
 * them (design spec A4): "stable" cannot mean "correct," because a resting
 * hand is stable too, and MediaPipe's VIDEO-mode tracking smooths frame to
 * frame, so even a wrong or half-formed pose reads as motionless once it has
 * held for a few frames. Grading whatever happens to be still -- mid-formation
 * or at rest -- would reward the wrong thing. The hold-still ring asks for the
 * same thing a human coach would ("hold it there"), not a correctness check.
 *
 * CORRECTNESS-BLIND BY CONSTRUCTION: this module never imports the model,
 * the letter target, or anything from js/core/ or config.js, and never asks
 * "is this right" -- only "has this stopped moving." That separation means
 * committing an attempt cannot itself leak whether the shape is correct: the
 * commit boundary is drawn without ever looking at a grade.
 *
 * FIX ROUND 1 (jitter is ABSOLUTE, tolerance was RELATIVE): the original
 * stillness check compared a single anchor frame to a single current frame
 * and divided by palm size -- a NOISE-VS-NOISE comparison, since MediaPipe's
 * per-frame jitter has a fixed size in image units regardless of how big the
 * hand looks. For a small or distant hand (small palm size S), the same
 * absolute jitter becomes a LARGER fraction of S, so a purely relative
 * tolerance (stillTol*S) shrinks toward zero exactly where jitter does not --
 * measured at 99.9% of 600ms holds spuriously resetting at hand size 0.15.
 * Two independent fixes, both required:
 *   - a tolerance FLOOR, `absTol` (raw isotropic units, not a fraction of S):
 *     `tol = max(stillTol*S, absTol)`. For a small hand this floor is what
 *     keeps jitter noise from resetting the ring at all -- stillTol*S alone
 *     is too small to see over the noise, so a fixed absolute minimum takes
 *     over.
 *   - SMOOTHING: compare the per-coordinate MEDIAN of several rows, not one
 *     frame, on both sides (median of the still period's first `SMOOTH_N`
 *     usable rows as a FIXED anchor once collected; median of the last
 *     `SMOOTH_N` usable rows as the current pose). One frame's jitter is
 *     mostly noise; five combined is close to the true position.
 *
 * FIX ROUND 2 (three problems the reviewer found in fix round 1's build):
 *   - C1, `minPalm`: the floor from round 1 has to be a fixed size in raw
 *     units, which means it does NOT shrink for a small hand -- and a small
 *     hand's SMOOTHED anchor/current comparison also carries a ~4-frame
 *     (~133ms) lag (median-of-5 vs. median-of-5 compares window CENTERS, not
 *     the latest sample), so a slow drift's measured displacement at
 *     t=holdMs is `v*(holdMs - ~133ms)`, not `v*holdMs`. At hand size 0.10
 *     that shortfall is enough for the check to never fire: a 0.2 palm/s
 *     drift measurably, deterministically COMMITTED. Below `minPalm`,
 *     stillness is not a measurable question -- signal and noise are the
 *     same size -- so the honest behavior is to refuse rather than guess:
 *     `state.tooSmall` goes true and no still period can run at all.
 *   - I2, `reset()`: fix round 1 read the controller's "the monotonicity
 *     guard survives reset()" as surviving a BARE reset() specifically,
 *     requiring an explicit reset(tMs) to cross an old high-water mark. That
 *     was the wrong reading -- js/core/recorder.js's tMs restarts near 0 on
 *     EVERY trial, and the tutor calls the plain reset() at every trial
 *     boundary, so the old reading crashed a normal session on trial 2. A
 *     bare reset() now always clears the guard; reset() takes no argument.
 *   - I3, the progress latch: `progress` is `(tMs-periodStart)/holdMs`
 *     clipped to 1, and once it hits 1 it STAYS there as tMs keeps climbing,
 *     with no mechanism to unstick it. If a still hold's present-fraction
 *     never clears `presentFrac` (e.g. one dropped frame in three, each
 *     individually well under the 300ms dropout threshold), the hold-time
 *     target is reached but the commit condition never passes -- so the old
 *     code just sat at progress=1 forever, the ring reading "done" while
 *     nothing happened. Now: reaching hold time without enough presence
 *     RESETS the period (restarting from this frame) instead of latching.
 *     `state.lastResetReason` says which of the four reasons the last reset
 *     was, so the UI can react appropriately.
 * FIX ROUND 3 (the minPalm boundary itself flapped): size 0.13's palmSize
 * (~0.1200) sits within single-frame measurement noise (std ~0.0019) of
 * `minPalm`'s default (0.12) -- round 2's RAW single-frame gate flipped
 * `tooSmall` on and off almost every frame for a hand at exactly that size,
 * and every flip reset the still period. A hard cutoff always has SOME
 * boundary; the fix is to make the boundary calm and documented rather than
 * moving it. Two changes: the gate now reads a SMOOTHED palm size (the
 * median of the last `SMOOTH_N` usable frames' `palmSize`, mirroring the
 * position smoothing above -- fix round 2's proposal (b)); and it uses
 * HYSTERESIS, not one threshold: `tooSmall` turns on when smoothed S drops
 * below `minPalm`, but only turns off once smoothed S climbs above
 * `minPalm * MIN_PALM_EXIT_FACTOR`. Without the gap, a hand sitting on the
 * threshold would flip state every few frames purely from size-measurement
 * noise; with it, a hand whose TRUE size sits below the exit threshold (as
 * 0.13's does -- 0.1200 can never clear 0.12*1.08=0.1296) enters `tooSmall`
 * at most once and then stays there, calmly, for as long as it stays that
 * size -- which is the honest answer, not a hidden default change.
 *
 * THREE ZONES, in plain words (wrist-to-middle-knuckle length as a fraction
 * of image height): >= 0.15 is the SUPPORTED range -- measured reliably,
 * and what the statistical battery in tests/commit.test.js asserts (0.15,
 * 0.25, 0.40 at 30fps and 12fps: spurious-reset rate < 2%, zero commits
 * under a 0.2 palm/s drift with jitter, a real fingertip change always
 * resets, and the hand is never `tooSmall`). Below ~0.12 the module REFUSES
 * outright (`state.tooSmall` true, no still period can run -- "move your
 * hand closer" is the honest answer, not a guess). In between (roughly
 * 0.12-0.15) is a GRAY ZONE: the module may call a hand in that range
 * measurable or too-small -- it is not required to say the same thing every
 * session, or even every few seconds, at that size -- but per this round it
 * MUST NOT FLAP within one session once it settles.
 *
 * See tests/commit.test.js for the measurements behind these numbers: the
 * jitter spurious-reset battery ("C1 acceptance: still-hand spurious-reset
 * rate < 2% at 0.15/0.25/0.40, 30fps and 12fps"); the drift battery ("C1
 * acceptance: 0.2 palm/s drift + jitter never commits at 0.15/0.25/0.40,
 * 30fps and 12fps (zero of >=300 trials)", together with "C1
 * characterization: noiseless drift at 12fps slips through at hand sizes
 * 0.13 and 0.15 (known concern, see report)" for the characterization of
 * exactly how small a hand can slip a slow drift through `minPalm`); and the
 * size/hysteresis test ("fix round 3: at hand size 0.13 held still for 3s
 * with standard jitter, tooSmall settles CALMLY -- changes at most once per
 * run, 30fps and 12fps, 100 seeds each") for the boundary-noise measurement
 * that motivated the hysteresis. Measured cost: ~19us/push (fix round 1
 * reviewer benchmark; later rounds add a few more scalar operations per push
 * and stay in the same range) -- cheap for a 30-60fps loop with headroom to
 * spare.
 *
 * Time comes ONLY from the `tMs` each caller passes to push() -- never
 * Date/performance/frame counts -- so a saved frame stream replays to the
 * exact same attempts every time. See push() for why `tMs` must never go
 * backwards, and reset() for how a new trial's clock is allowed to restart. */

// settleMs, then runs 0 -> 1 over the rest of holdMs. The commit itself still
// lands at holdMs exactly, so settleMs changes what is SHOWN, never what is

//
// `stillSkip` / `rearmSkip`: how many of the LARGEST per-landmark
// displacements are ignored before the comparison (0 = the plain maximum).
// `stillPerFinger`: instead, take each finger's SECOND largest landmark
// displacement and then the largest of those five. Measured on real tracked
// video (research/live/REPORT.md, 60 labeled held letters, three signers):
// with the plain maximum at stillTol 0.06, 12% of the frames INSIDE a held
// letter broke the hold and 11 of 60 holds ever closed a 600 ms ring -- single
// landmarks (an occluded fingertip, the wrist) hop while the hand is still.
// Ignoring the k largest overall fixes that and opens a hole: a finger curling
// at its middle joint moves only its last two landmarks, which are exactly the
// two ignored. Per finger, one hopping landmark in EACH finger is ignored,
// and a finger with two landmarks travelling together is a moving finger.
// (research/live/eval-still-policies.mjs compares them on the real video.)
// The module's defaults stay where its statistical battery characterizes
// them; the tutor passes the measured values (TUTOR_COMMIT_OPTS).
//
// `placeTol`: when it is a finite number, stillness is judged in two parts.
// SHAPE -- the pose with its palm centre removed -- has to stay within
// stillTol; PLACE -- the palm centre itself -- only within placeTol (both in
// palm widths). Grading does not depend on where the hand is, so a
// hand wobbling as a whole on the end of a raised arm is not a hand that is
// changing shape, and on the real video it was whole-hand wobble, not fingers,
// that broke genuinely held letters: split this way with a TIGHTER shape
// tolerance, a comparison script at a 600 ms hold closed 42 of 60 real holds
// against 11 for the plain rule, and the grader accepted every pose those
// holds committed. (A comparison, on fluent signers holding 0.7-1.7 s: not a
// rate to expect from this module at a longer hold. tests/real-holds.test.js
// runs the real module on a real clip at learner-like speed.)
// Infinity (the default) is the original single comparison.
//
// `stillAlign`: SHAPE is compared twice and the SMALLER distance counts: as
// above, and again after the current pose has been turned and scaled in the
// picture plane to sit on the anchor's palm (alignedTo). Without it a hand is
// only "still" if it is not turning: a fingertip sits about two palm widths
// from the palm centre, so THREE DEGREES of wrist rock moves it the whole 0.10
// tolerance, and on the first recorded session a synthetic 12-degree rock
// closed 10 of 57 rings and half a palm of sway closed 5
// (research/recordings-2026-09-21/). Turning the whole hand is not a change of
// shape; a finger bending still is, aligned or not, because the alignment is
// fitted to the palm and a finger moves against it. The smaller of the two
// rather than the aligned one alone: fitting an angle to five noisy palm
// landmarks adds a little noise of its own, and a hand that IS still must
// never do worse than it did before. With stillAlign, placeTol Infinity means
// "anywhere" instead of "one comparison".
//
// `heldOverShape` / `heldOverPlace`: what it takes to re-arm a committer that
// nextTrial() carried over disarmed. Deliberately MUCH more than rearmTol. The
// two mistakes are not alike: re-arming too readily grades the last letter's
// pose against the next letter (the burst), and tracker noise on a hand nobody
// has moved reaches rearmTol within a second on real video; re-arming too
// reluctantly asks the learner to do what they do between two signs anyway --
// the status line says so -- and any two different letters differ by far more
// than this. Shape in palm widths (shapeDistance), place likewise, or the
// hand gone for DROPOUT_MS. heldOverPlace Infinity: place never re-arms --
// needed once a MOVING hand can commit (stillAlign), or a learner swaying with
// the last letter still up re-arms by place and has it graded as the next.
//
// `rearmAfterMs`: a disarmed committer normally re-arms only when the hand
// moves away from the pose it committed. Some real corrections are smaller
// than any safe movement threshold ("spread your fingers a little"), and the
// learner would face a dead ring for doing as they were told. After this long
// disarmed, WITHIN a trial, the committer re-arms anyway: a pose held that
// long after a verdict is a second answer. Never across a trial boundary
// (nextTrial): that is exactly the burst. Infinity turns it off.
